# Project Journal Ep. 8
**Jul 20th, 2020**

## Objectives
- Out of scope, RnD activity: Find a way to integrate a storage caching layer with Rucio and the JupyterLab extension.

## Challenges
- Unfamiliar with setting up XRootD and XCache.
  - Resolved: Had a call with Riccardo to give a tutorial on how to setup the environment.
- Tried installing N2N Rucio plugin in Riccardo's XRootD Docker containers.
  - Followed steps in [https://github.com/xrootd/rucioN2N-for-Xcache/wiki/Introduction-to-Xrootd-N2N-for-Disk-Caching-Proxy-(Xcache)-utilizing-RUCIO-metalink](https://github.com/xrootd/rucioN2N-for-Xcache/wiki/Introduction-to-Xrootd-N2N-for-Disk-Caching-Proxy-(Xcache)-utilizing-RUCIO-metalink)
  - No luck, but I think the plugin is loaded, just not used. This line was present in the log: `200730 07:47:45 024 Posix_P2L: file /rucio/test:file1 pfn2lfn /atlas/rucio/test/80/25/file1`
  - But, there's no sign of an HTTP call being made to Rucio.
  - Additionally, the prefix `/atlas` and the Rucio hostname are hardcoded in the code.

## Observations
- When using `xrdfs root://cache:1094//root://origin:1094//filename.txt`, the origin part is ignored and configuration value is used instead.
  - Tried changing `origin` to something else, `ls` would still work.
  - Default value is `<I forgot the hostname>.cern.ch`, so it must be changed to use `xrdfs`.
- When using `xrdcp root://cache:1094//root://origin:1094//filename.txt`, the origin part is considered.
  - However, once successfully cached, only the filename is checked.
  - Changing the origin address after that first successful fetch won't make a difference. See [Console Output 1](#console-output-1).
    - Could be problematic, what if two files with the same path but different origin want to be fetched?
