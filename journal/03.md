# Project Journal Ep. 3
**June 1st, 2020 - **

## Objectives
- Create a UI skeleton
- Create configuration system that supports remote config
- Create an SQLite3 database for storing caches
- Create several simple serverextension endpoints

## Challenges
- Not sure about how the extension would behave on JupyterHub installations
  - How will the serverextension see the home directory. Will it be the logged in user or the host OS's homedir?
- Typical CSS struggles
  - Vertical centering, icon not aligning well, etc.
- Slow development cycle
  - Every time the serverextension changes, `pip install .` and `jupyter lab` must be run, which could take a couple of minutes.
  - For non JL-specific codes like Tornado handlers and SQLite, the development is done externally, and the ported to JL later on.

## Observations
(None)

## Results
- Created UI skeleton
- Created local and remote config system
- Created SQLite-based preferences & cache persistence
- Created instance selection page
  - Selection persisted to database
