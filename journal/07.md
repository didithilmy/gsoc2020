# Project Journal Ep. 7
**Jul 4th, 2020 - Jul 20th, 2020**

## Objectives
- Variable injection bugfix (won't inject after kernel restart)
- Implement polling for injected variables
- Setup Dockerfile and publish to Docker Hub
- Implement download mode
- Implement wildcard search
- Implement dark theme

## Challenges
No significant challenges.

## Observations
- JupyterLab uses CSS `var()` to implement themeing.
- Rucio `DownloadClient` requires a config file to be placed in a directory, defined in an environment variable. To make the extension work, a temporary directory and config file are created and deleted after the download is finished.

## Results
- Variable now injected after kernel restart
- Injected DIDs are now polled if they have replicating status, even when they're not opened in the Explore menu.
- Published a Docker image of `jupyter/scipy-notebook` with the extension installed.
- Implemented download mode.
- Implemented wildcard search and file DID browser.
- Implemented dark theme support.
- Added new configuration items for extension mode and whether wildcard search is enabled.
