# Project Journal Ep. 5
**June 18th, 2020 - June 26th, 2020**

## Objectives
- Make unit tests
  - Jest in TS
  - Pytest in Python
- Make GitHub Actions workflow

## Challenges
- Not familiar with unit testing framework in TypeScript and Python
- Hard to gauge whether the unit test is good or not.
  - Should I mock this function?
  - Haven't found a way to test some units
    - Function calls with function as the parameter: How to assert it?
    - React user interfaces: How to test? Which ones should be tested? Very dynamic (for now), lots of moving parts that can change. Should it be tested at all?

## Observations
- Good tests need good codes

## Results
- Created Python unit tests with 95% coverage
- Created TS unit tests
  - Excluding React ones :(
- Created GitHub Actions workflow that performs tests and lints on push/PR to `master`.
